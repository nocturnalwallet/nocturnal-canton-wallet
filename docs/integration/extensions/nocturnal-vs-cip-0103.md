# Nocturnal vs CIP-0103

A precise list of where Nocturnal's dApp API deviates from vanilla CIP-0103. Every deviation is intentional and documented here so dApp developers know what to expect.

## Categories

- **Extensions** — Nocturnal provides more than the spec defines. dApps using only the spec aren't affected.
- **Limitations** — Nocturnal provides less than the spec defines. Documented so dApps don't expect the missing surface.
- **Deferred upstream** — gaps the spec defines but the official `@canton-network/dapp-sdk` doesn't implement either, awaiting upstream wiring.

## Extensions

### `signTransaction` method

CIP-0103 has no `signTransaction` method. Nocturnal adds one to sign a 32-byte transaction hash directly. See [reference/signing.md](../reference/signing.md#signtransaction).

**Why kept:** existing Canton dApps rely on it. For new code, prefer `prepareExecute` / `prepareExecuteAndWait` — they follow the spec.

**Return shape:** `{ signature, publicKey, fingerprint }` (extension shape; spec has no equivalent).

**Where to call from:** not exposed as a top-level `@canton-network/dapp-sdk` helper. Reach for the raw provider:

```ts
import { getConnectedProvider } from '@canton-network/dapp-sdk';
const provider = getConnectedProvider();
const { signature } = await provider!.request({ method: 'signTransaction', params: { transactionHash } });
```

### `SPLICE_WALLET_EVENT` envelope variant

The standard CIP-0103 `WalletEvent` enum has 7 members (the request/response pair plus the extension handshake plus IdP auth events). Nocturnal adds an 8th: `SPLICE_WALLET_EVENT`, used to push `statusChanged` / `accountsChanged` notifications from the background to the dApp.

```ts
// Nocturnal-pushed event envelope:
{
  type: 'SPLICE_WALLET_EVENT',
  event: 'statusChanged' | 'accountsChanged',
  data: unknown,  // for statusChanged: StatusEvent; for accountsChanged: Wallet[]
}
```

**Why kept:** see [Deferred upstream](#deferred-upstream) below — upstream's `DappSyncProvider` (the extension flow) doesn't yet have any event delivery mechanism, so even spec-conformant push events have no consumer. Nocturnal's own internal logic and downstream Nocturnal-aware dApps use this channel today.

**How a dApp consumes it (without the SDK):**

```js
window.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
  const m = e.data;
  if (m?.type !== 'SPLICE_WALLET_EVENT') return;
  switch (m.event) {
    case 'statusChanged':
      refreshUiFor(m.data);  // m.data has the StatusEvent shape
      break;
    case 'accountsChanged':
      onAccountsChanged(m.data);  // m.data is a Wallet[]
      break;
  }
});
```

When upstream ships a spec-conformant push channel for the extension flow, this envelope will be deprecated in favor of the upstream mechanism. Until then, Nocturnal offers it as the only way to receive realtime wallet state updates.

## Limitations

### Single-account wallet

CIP-0103's `listAccounts` is defined to return an array of all accounts the wallet manages. Nocturnal currently returns at most one account — the active party for the current network.

**Why:** the wallet's onboarding flow creates exactly one party per network per user. Multi-party-per-user isn't a product requirement yet.

**Impact:** dApps should still iterate `listAccounts` rather than assume length 1, in case Nocturnal gains multi-account support in the future.

### `connect` is synchronous-only (no IdP login)

CIP-0103 defines an async `connect` variant where the wallet returns a `{ userUrl }` and the dApp drives the user through an IdP (Google OAuth, etc.) login flow before connection completes.

Nocturnal's `connect` is always synchronous. The user has already signed into Google OAuth via the wallet popup *before* any dApp call; the dApp never sees the auth flow.

**Impact:** no `SPLICE_WALLET_IDP_AUTH_SUCCESS` event will ever be fired from Nocturnal. The envelope variant is accepted (for compatibility) but never originated. If a dApp expects to drive the login flow, it won't work with Nocturnal today.

### No `messageSignature` lifecycle events

CIP-0103's spec defines `messageSignature` events (`pending` → `signed`/`failed`) that fire during a `signMessage` call. Nocturnal doesn't emit them.

**Why:** Nocturnal's `signMessage` is synchronous behind the approval popup — the user clicks Approve, the wallet signs immediately, the promise resolves. There's no "pending" phase visible to the dApp that would benefit from a lifecycle event.

**Impact:** dApps that subscribe to `messageSignature` events won't receive any from Nocturnal. Use the promise return from `signMessage` instead.

### `getPrimaryAccount` not in the top-level SDK surface

`@canton-network/dapp-sdk` exports top-level helpers for most CIP-0103 methods (`connect`, `disconnect`, `isConnected`, `status`, `listAccounts`, `prepareExecute`, `prepareExecuteAndWait`, `signMessage`, `ledgerApi`) but not `getPrimaryAccount`. The method still works — call it through `getConnectedProvider().request({ method: 'getPrimaryAccount' })`.

For most dApps, `listAccounts()[0]` (or `accounts.find(a => a.primary)`) gives the same answer without the extra hop.

## Deferred upstream

### `prepareExecute` lifecycle events

CIP-0103 defines `txChanged` lifecycle events (`pending` → `signed` → `executed`/`failed`) that fire during a `prepareExecute` call so the dApp can show progress UI without polling.

**Status in Nocturnal:** not emitted. Our `prepareExecute` is "fire and resolve" — the promise resolves with `null` (per spec) after the backend completes the prepare + execute steps.

**Status upstream:** the `@canton-network/dapp-sdk`'s `DappSyncProvider` (used for extension flows) uses `WindowTransport`, which is request/response only. It has no listener for these events. The reference Splice wallet-gateway extension stubs `txChanged` with `throw new Error('Only for events.')`. So even if Nocturnal emitted spec-conformant events, no SDK consumer would receive them.

**When this will be fixed:** awaiting upstream wiring of an event delivery channel for the extension flow. Track at [hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/splice-wallet-kernel).

In the meantime, dApps can use:
- The promise return from `prepareExecuteAndWait` (which carries the spec-shape `{ tx: TxChangedExecutedEvent }` and resolves only on commit).
- Nocturnal's `SPLICE_WALLET_EVENT` channel for `statusChanged` / `accountsChanged` (Nocturnal extension, see above).

### Multi-wallet routing (`target` field)

CIP-0103 defines an optional `target: string` on the SpliceMessage envelope so dApps can route requests to a specific wallet extension by ID when multiple are installed.

**Status in Nocturnal:** supported on incoming (`SPLICE_WALLET_REQUEST` / `SPLICE_WALLET_EXT_READY` / `SPLICE_WALLET_EXT_OPEN`) and echoed on outgoing (`SPLICE_WALLET_EXT_ACK`). dApps using `@canton-network/dapp-sdk`'s discovery (via `init()`) will see Nocturnal announced with `target: chrome.runtime.id` and can route subsequent calls correctly.

**Note:** if a dApp omits `target`, Nocturnal accepts the message and processes it — same behavior as the upstream reference extension.
